#battery/basics/modeling_approaches 

First paper towards dendrite modeling, which needs reaction transport is done by #references/battery/dendrite/sph/tartakovsky2007simulations. 

From #references/battery/sph/tan2020simulating , we consider an Li metal anode and an adjacent thin diffusion layer of the electrolyte (100 $\micro m$) near the interface. The model considered simulates lithium plating on the surface of the Li metal anode as well as the ionic mass transport within a thin diffusion layer (~100 μm) near the interface
