# 1.1 Introduction to the course

1. Cells are the smallest individual electrochemical unit and deliver a voltage that depends on the cell chemistry
	1. There are primary (single use, the one we can purchase from the grocery store) and secondary (rechargable) cells.
2. Battery and a cell are different things. Battery is a group of cells.

#battery/basics/nominal_voltage
3. Cell (nominal) voltage depends on the chemicals it is made of
#battery/basics/nominal_capacity
4. Cell (nominal) capacity is the quantity of charge, in Ampere hours (Ah), the battery can hold.
#battery/basics/c-rate
5. Based on the nominal capacity, we define C-rate, which is a relative measure of cell current. It is the constant current charge or discharge rate that the cell can sustain for one hour. A 20 Ah cell deliver 20 A ("1C") for 1 h or 2 A ("C/10") for 10 h. If it is discharged at a 10 C rate, it will be completely discharged in six minutes.
#battery/basics/energy_stored
6. Total energy stored in a battery = nominal votage $\times$ nominal capacity
7. Cells instantaneous power =  energy release rate (W or KW)
8. Battery in series will have same capacity but added voltage
9. Battery in parallel will have same voltage but added capacity
10. Specific energy or energy density are measure of the maximum amount of stored energy per unit weight or volume


# 1.2 How electrochemical cells work

The negative electrode: made up of metal or an alloy or hydrogen. During discharge, gives up electrons is oxidized (OIL) and during charge accepts electrons is reduced. Universally, we say anode as a constant, which is considered during discharge.


# 1.3 Choice of active materials

From periodic table, we have several materials of choice. Ultimately each material is trying to get its valence electrons rule satisfied.


# 1.4 Lithium-ion cell preview

1. Good cell in secondary cells category
2. Can support $3.7$ V. Lower self-discharge rate
3. Lithium-ion cells depend on "intercalation" mechanism
4. That involves the insertion of lithium-ions into the crystalline lattice of the host electrode without changing the crystalline structure
5. Lithium is stored int he electrodes much like water is stored in a sponge
6. Li is stored in electrodes and $Li^+$ moves through the electrolyte
8. $Li^+$  enters the electrode, becoming Li when an electron is available
9. During discharge Li becomes $Li^+$ and goes from negative electrode to positive electrode
10. This process is completely reversible
